# GPIO_Gamepad
This is a simple game controller from GPIO input on raspberry pi
It is written in the simplest way possible, because I dont know yet what the needs of the project will be by the end of it.

This is a part of a bigger project, a portable gaming machine powered by a Raspberry Pi and its going to be completely open source even the CAD models for 3d printing.
