# GPIO_Gamepad
This is a barebones low level virtual game controller from GPIO input on raspberry pi.
It emulates a connected xbox controller and translates basic GPIO Button inputs as controller inputs. Tested with Steam Input system and works great.


It is written in the simplest way possible, because I dont know yet what the needs of the project will be by the end of it.
