# GPIO_Gamepad
This is a barebones low level virtual game controller from GPIO input on Raspberry Pi.
It emulates a connected xbox style controller and translates basic GPIO Button inputs as controller inputs. Tested with Steam Input, old Steamlink for Rasbian, and various third party progams, all seem to work as expected.
Needs the pigpio library that should be installed in your Rasbian already
